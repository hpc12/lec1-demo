 * These examples are written in C99. You will need the compiler flag
 * -std=c99 to compile it.
 *
 * To make the timestamp functions and their datatypes available, you need to
pass * -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500 to the compiler.
 *
 * If you get this error:
 * timing-example.c:(.text+0xd9): undefined reference to `clock_gettime'
 * timing-example.c:(.text+0x108): undefined reference to `clock_gettime'
 * then you'll need to the -lrt flag, too.
 *
 * Summary: Assuming you've saved this file as 'timing-example.c',
 * use this to compile:
 *
 * gcc -std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500 -lrt timing-example.c
